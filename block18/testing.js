//Unit Tests

//Testing "multiplication" Function:

// With Positive Multiplication:

//Expect the function with two positive integer inputs.
//Use assert or your testing library to check if the result is the product of the inputs.

//With Zero Inputs:

//Expect the function with one or both inputs as zero.
//Verify that the function correctly returns 0.

// With Negative Multiplication:

//Expect  the function with at least one negative integer input.
//Check if the function returns the correct negative product.

// With Negative Inputs:

//Expect the function with two negative integer inputs.
//Ensure that the function returns a positive product.

// With Unexpected Inputs:

//Expect the function with unexpected inputs, such as non-numeric values or objects.
//Verify that the function handles these cases gracefully, potentially returning an error or providing a clear message.

//Testing "concatOdds" Function:


//Arrays with Odd Numbers:

//Test the function with two arrays that contain odd numbers.
//Check if the function returns a single array containing all odd numbers from both arrays, sorted in ascending order.

//With Empty Array:

//Expect one of the input arrays as empty.
//Verify that the function correctly returns the sorted odd numbers from the non-empty array.

//With Both Arrays Empty:

//Expect both input arrays as empty.
//Ensure that the function returns an empty array.
//Arrays with Only Even Numbers:

//Test the function with two arrays that contain only even numbers.
//Check if the function returns an empty array.

//With Arrays with Duplicate Odd Numbers:

//Expect  the function with arrays containing multiples of the same odd numbers.
//Verify that the function includes only one occurrence of each odd number in the result, ensuring there are no duplicates.

//Unexpected Inputs:

//Test the function with unexpected inputs, such as non-integer values or objects.
//Ensure that the function handles these cases gracefully, potentially skipping them.//



// Functional Tests

// First esting the Shopping Cart Checkout Feature:
